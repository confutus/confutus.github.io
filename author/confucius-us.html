<blockquote>
<p>Petition to the Committee of the Council </p>
<p>We, the undersigned, having serious reservations about the presence of  the Confucius Institute within the academic program of the University of  Chicago, respectfully request that the Council of the Faculty Senate  debate and decide whether to renew the contract this Fall with the Head  Office of the Confucius Institutes, Beijing (Hanban). For reasons that  follow, we believe that the Council has jurisdiction in this matter, and  that terminating the relationship with the Confucius Institutes would be  consistent with the intellectual principles and values of the University: </p>
<p>--Although it is generally acknowledged that decisions concerning the  establishment of entities with teaching responsibilities (“education”)  fall within the purview of the Council for approval, and although the  original Agreement with Hanban signed on 29 September 2009 prominently  included such teaching, the creation of the Confucius Institute was not  brought before the Council at that time. We believe it now falls to the  Council to remedy that oversight with regard to a contract with Hanban  which specifies: in Article 4, that the Confucius Institute will  undertake the teaching of Chinese language, provide Chinese language  teaching resources, and train Chinese language instructors; and in  Article 6, that Hanban will provide 3000 volumes of Chinese books,  teaching materials, and audio visual materials, as well as “send  sufficient numbers of qualified instructors…and pay for their airfares  and salaries.” (The Agreement of September, 2009 is appended to this email.) </p>
<p>--The dubious practice of allowing an external institution to staff  academic courses within the University is here exacerbated by the fact  that Hanban is an agency of the Chinese government, and that the global  agenda of Hanban, according to its own Constitution and ByLaws, is set  by high officials of the Party-State, to whom the Head Office reports  annually. It may also be noted that research proposals approved by the  Chicago Confucius Institute are sent to Hanban for approval for funding. </p>
<p>--Among the problems posed by Hanban’s control of the hiring and  training of teachers is that that it thus subjects the University’s  academic program to the political constraints on free speech and belief  that are specific to the People’s Republic of China. The more so since  the Hanban Constitution specifies that Chinese law applies to the  activities of Confucius Institutes, and that the University of Chicago’s  role in the hiring does not extend to the selection of the Hanban  teachers. The University apparently reserves the right to refuse  teachers proposed by Hanban, but that right has never been exercised.  Among the unwanted effects, the University may well be complicit, then,  in discriminatory hiring, as was exposed in the well-known case of  McMaster University in 2011-12. A Hanban teacher was dismissed when it  was revealed she was a follower of Falun Gong; and when the case was  brought before the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, McMaster was put in  the position of defending itself against a charge of discriminatory  hiring contrary to Canadian law and its own academic principles.  McMaster thereupon did not renew its contract with Hanban. Indeed the  Governing Council of the Canadian Association of University Teachers,  representing some 68,000 teachers in more than 120 colleges and  universities, recently passed a resolution “calling on universities and  colleges in Canada which currently host Confucius Institutes on their  campuses to cease doing so. And those contemplating such arrangements to  pursue them no further.” In an accompanying statement, the Executive  Director observed that Canadian colleges and universities were  compromising their own integrity by allowing Hanban ”to have a voice in  a number of academic matters such as curriculum, texts, and topics of  class discussions.” </p>
<p>--It was established in the McMaster case and has since been  corroborated as well in an American secondary school CI (“Confucius  Classroom”) that the Hanban teachers are trained to ignore or divert  questions on issues that are politically taboo in China, or indeed  criminalized, such as the status of Taiwan, Tiananmen, the pro-Democracy  movement, etc. These questions do arise in Chinese language classrooms,  even as they may be prompted in videos or the history texts of advanced  language courses. A petition submitted to the New South Wales Parliament  in 2011, signed by some 10,000 citizens, called for the termination of  CI Confucius Classrooms in the public secondary and primary schools of  the province, on the grounds that “the NSW government has admitted that  topics sensitive to the Chinese government including Taiwan, Tibet,  Falun Gong, and human rights violations would not be included in these  classes,” and that “Confucius classes are directly linked to and funded  by the Chinese government.” </p>
<p>--Although the University of Chicago has ignored the provisions in the  Agreement specifying that Hanban will supply texts and course materials  for Chinese language instruction, this is not the case in the numerous  smaller colleges in the US and around the world, as well as in the  hundreds of Confucius Classrooms in secondary and primary schools, that  are not in a position to provide their own Chinese language curriculum.  In Chicago public schools alone, there are 42 Confucius classrooms  operating by Hanban rules. </p>
<p>--Although as just noted, the University of Chicago is hosting a CI  under privileges not available to many other schools, the effect is  that, mindful only of its own welfare, the University is participating  in a worldwide, politico-pedagogical project that is contrary in many  respects to its own academic values. Indeed by lending its good name to  the CI project, the University, nolens volens, is helping to promote an  enterprise that compromises the academic integrity of many universities  around the world even as it is inimical to its own. </p>
<p>For these reasons, we urge the Council of the Senate to terminate the  contract with the Confucius Institutes.</p>
