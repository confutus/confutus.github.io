<p>A petition was circulated in Chicago protesting the Confucius Institute&nbsp;there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Petition to the Committee of the&nbsp;Council </p>
<p>We, the undersigned, having serious reservations about the presence of the Confucius Institute within the academic program of the University of Chicago, respectfully request that the Council of the Faculty Senate debate and decide whether to renew the contract this Fall with the Head Office of the Confucius Institutes, Beijing (Hanban). For reasons that follow, we believe that the Council has jurisdiction in this matter, and that terminating the relationship with the Confucius Institutes would be consistent with the intellectual principles and values of the&nbsp;University: </p>
<p>&#8212;Although it is generally acknowledged that decisions concerning the establishment of entities with teaching responsibilities (“education”) fall within the purview of the Council for approval, and although the original Agreement with Hanban signed on 29 September 2009 prominently included such teaching, the creation of the Confucius Institute was not brought before the Council at that time. We believe it now falls to the Council to remedy that oversight with regard to a contract with Hanban which specifies: in Article 4, that the Confucius Institute will undertake the teaching of Chinese language, provide Chinese language teaching resources, and train Chinese language instructors; and in Article 6, that Hanban will provide 3000 volumes of Chinese books, teaching materials, and audio visual materials, as well as “send sufficient numbers of qualified instructors…and pay for their airfares and salaries.” (The Agreement of September, 2009 is appended to this&nbsp;email.) </p>
<p>&#8212;The dubious practice of allowing an external institution to staff academic courses within the University is here exacerbated by the fact that Hanban is an agency of the Chinese government, and that the global agenda of Hanban, according to its own Constitution and ByLaws, is set by high officials of the Party-State, to whom the Head Office reports annually. It may also be noted that research proposals approved by the Chicago Confucius Institute are sent to Hanban for approval for&nbsp;funding. </p>
<p>&#8212;Among the problems posed by Hanban’s control of the hiring and training of teachers is that that it thus subjects the University’s academic program to the political constraints on free speech and belief that are specific to the People’s Republic of China. The more so since the Hanban Constitution specifies that Chinese law applies to the activities of Confucius Institutes, and that the University of Chicago’s role in the hiring does not extend to the selection of the Hanban teachers. The University apparently reserves the right to refuse teachers proposed by Hanban, but that right has never been exercised. Among the unwanted effects, the University may well be complicit, then, in discriminatory hiring, as was exposed in the well-known case of McMaster University in 2011-12. A Hanban teacher was dismissed when it was revealed she was a follower of Falun Gong; and when the case was brought before the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, McMaster was put in the position of defending itself against a charge of discriminatory hiring contrary to Canadian law and its own academic principles. McMaster thereupon did not renew its contract with Hanban. Indeed the Governing Council of the Canadian Association of University Teachers, representing some 68,000 teachers in more than 120 colleges and universities, recently passed a resolution “calling on universities and colleges in Canada which currently host Confucius Institutes on their campuses to cease doing so. And those contemplating such arrangements to pursue them no further.” In an accompanying statement, the Executive Director observed that Canadian colleges and universities were compromising their own integrity by allowing Hanban ”to have a voice in a number of academic matters such as curriculum, texts, and topics of class&nbsp;discussions.” </p>
<p>&#8212;It was established in the McMaster case and has since been corroborated as well in an American secondary school <span class="caps">CI</span> (“Confucius Classroom”) that the Hanban teachers are trained to ignore or divert questions on issues that are politically taboo in China, or indeed criminalized, such as the status of Taiwan, Tiananmen, the pro-Democracy movement, etc. These questions do arise in Chinese language classrooms, even as they may be prompted in videos or the history texts of advanced language courses. A petition submitted to the New South Wales Parliament in 2011, signed by some 10,000 citizens, called for the termination of <span class="caps">CI</span> Confucius Classrooms in the public secondary and primary schools of the province, on the grounds that “the <span class="caps">NSW</span> government has admitted that topics sensitive to the Chinese government including Taiwan, Tibet, Falun Gong, and human rights violations would not be included in these classes,” and that “Confucius classes are directly linked to and funded by the Chinese&nbsp;government.” </p>
<p>&#8212;Although the University of Chicago has ignored the provisions in the Agreement specifying that Hanban will supply texts and course materials for Chinese language instruction, this is not the case in the numerous smaller colleges in the <span class="caps">US</span> and around the world, as well as in the hundreds of Confucius Classrooms in secondary and primary schools, that are not in a position to provide their own Chinese language curriculum. In Chicago public schools alone, there are 42 Confucius classrooms operating by Hanban&nbsp;rules. </p>
<p>&#8212;Although as just noted, the University of Chicago is hosting a <span class="caps">CI</span> under privileges not available to many other schools, the effect is that, mindful only of its own welfare, the University is participating in a worldwide, politico-pedagogical project that is contrary in many respects to its own academic values. Indeed by lending its good name to the <span class="caps">CI</span> project, the University, nolens volens, is helping to promote an enterprise that compromises the academic integrity of many universities around the world even as it is inimical to its&nbsp;own. </p>
<p>For these reasons, we urge the Council of the Senate to terminate the contract with the Confucius&nbsp;Institutes.</p>
